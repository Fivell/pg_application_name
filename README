pg-application-name
===================

Stamps an ActiveRecord connection point to a Postgres database with
the process id of this rails process.

This is accomplished by setting the 'application_name' connection
variable on the ActiveRecord connection.

By default all ActiveRecord connections will be stamped with the
process id, as:

  rails_development=# select procpid,usename,application_name,current_query from pg_stat_activity;
   procpid | usename  |        application_name       |                                current_query                                 
  ---------+----------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     27054 | postgres | Examples::Application/pid=805 | select procpid,usename,application_name,current_query from pg_stat_activity;
  (1 row)

The application name can be set:

  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.set_server_application_name("#{Rails.application.class.name}-8.0.5/pid=#{Process.pid}")
